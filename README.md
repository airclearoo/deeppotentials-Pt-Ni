This repository provides the deep potential model parameters for Pt-Ni alloys and elemental Pt/Ni, developed in support of the research presented in our thesis. The model is compatible with LAMMPS when compiled with the DeepMD-kit package, enabling molecular dynamics simulations as described in the associated work.
To obtain the model, clone this repository using Git:


git clone  https://github.com/airclearoo/deeppotentials-Pt-Ni.git
